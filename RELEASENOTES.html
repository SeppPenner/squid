<EM>This document contains the release notes for version 3.0 of Squid.
Squid is a WWW Cache application developed by the National Laboratory
for Applied Network Research and members of the Web Caching community.</EM>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="s1">1. Notice</A></H2>

<P>The Squid Team are pleased to announce the release of Squid-3.0.PRE7 for pre-release testing.</P>
<P>This new release is available for download from 
<A HREF="http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.0/">http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.0/</A> or the 
<A HREF="http://www.squid-cache.org/Mirrors/http-mirrors.html">mirrors</A>.</P>
<P>A large number of the show-stopper bugs have been fixed along with general improvements to the ICAP support.
While this release is not deemed ready for production use, we believe it is ready for wider testing by the community.</P>
<P>We welcome feedback and bug reports. If you find a bug, please see 
<A HREF="http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/TroubleShooting#head-7067fc0034ce967e67911becaabb8c95a34d576d">http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/TroubleShooting#head-7067fc0034ce967e67911becaabb8c95a34d576d</A> for how to submit a report with a stack trace.</P>

<H2><A NAME="s2">2. Known issues</A></H2>

<P>Although this release is deemed good enough for testing in many setups, please note the existence of

<P>In particular, ESI may still be too buggy for meaningful testing at this stage.</P>

<H2><A NAME="s3">3. Changes since earlier PRE releases of Squid-3.0</A></H2>

<P>The 3.0 change history can be 
<A HREF="http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.0/changesets/">viewed here</A>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="s4">4. Changes since Squid-2.6</A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 Major new features</A>
</H2>

<P>Squid 3.0 represents a major rewrite of Squid and has a number of new features.</P>
<P>The most important of these are:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Edge Side Include implementation (www.esi.org)</LI>
<LI>ICAP implementation (www.i-cap.org)</LI>
<LI>Finer control over cacheability (refresh_pattern)</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>Most user-facing changes are reflected in squid.conf (see below).</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2 2.6 features not found in Squid-3.0</A>
</H2>

<P>Some of the features found in Squid-2.6 is not available in Squid-3.
Some has been dropped as they are not needed. Some has not yet been forward-ported to Squid-3 and may appear in a later release.</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>refresh_stale_hit option. Not yet ported.</LI>
<LI>ability to follow X-Forwarded-For. Not yet ported.</LI>
<LI>Full caching of Vary/ETag using If-None-Match. Only basic Vary cache supported. Not yet ported.</LI>
<LI>Mapping of server error messages. Not yet ported.</LI>
<LI>http_access2 access directive. Not yet ported.</LI>
<LI>Location header rewrites. Not yet ported.</LI>
<LI>umask directive. Not yet ported.</LI>
<LI>wais_relay. Feature dropped as it's equivalent to cache_peer + cache_peer_access.</LI>
<LI>urlgroup. Not yet ported.</LI>
<LI>collapsed forwarding. Not yet ported.</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss4.3">4.3 Logging changes</A>
</H2>

<H3>access.log</H3>

<P>The TCP_REFRESH_HIT and TCP_REFRESH_MISS log types have been replaced because they were misleading (all refreshes need to query the origin server, so they could never be hits). The following log types have been introduced to replace them:</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>TCP_REFRESH_UNMODIFIED</B><DD><P>The requested object was cached but STALE. The IMS query for the object resulted in "304 not modified".</P>
<DT><B>TCP_REFRESH_MODIFIED</B><DD><P>The requested object was cached but STALE. The IMS query returned the new content.
</P>
</DL>
</P>
<P>See 
<A HREF="http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/FAQ/FAQ-6.html#ss6.7">http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/FAQ/FAQ-6.html#ss6.7</A> for a definition of all log types.</P>




<H2><A NAME="ss4.4">4.4 Changes to squid.conf</A>
</H2>

<P>There have been many changes to Squid's configuration file since Squid-2.6.</P>
<P>This section gives a thorough account of those changes in three categories:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
<A HREF="#newtags">New tags</A></LI>
<LI>
<A HREF="#modifiedtags">Changes to existing tags</A></LI>
<LI>
<A HREF="#removedtags">Removed tags</A></LI>
</UL>
</P>





<H3><A NAME="newtags"></A> New tags</H3>

<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>minimum_icp_query_timeout (msec)</B><DD><P>
<PRE>
Default: 5

Normally the ICP query timeout is determined dynamically.  But
sometimes it can lead to very small timeouts, even lower than
the normal latency variance on your link due to traffic.
Use this option to put an lower limit on the dynamic timeout
value.  Do NOT use this option to always use a fixed (instead
of a dynamic) timeout value. To set a fixed timeout see the
'icp_query_timeout' directive.
        
</PRE>
</P>
<DT><B>background_ping_rate</B><DD><P>
<PRE>
Default: 10 seconds

Controls how often the ICP pings are sent to siblings that
have background-ping set.
        
</PRE>
</P>

<DT><B>httpd_accel_surrogate_id</B><DD><P>
<PRE>
Default: unset

Surrogates (http://www.esi.org/architecture_spec_1.0.html)
need an identification token to allow control targeting. Because
a farm of surrogates may all perform the same tasks, they may share
an identification token.
        
</PRE>
</P>

<DT><B>http_accel_surrogate_remote on|off</B><DD><P>
<PRE>
Default: off

Remote surrogates (such as those in a CDN) honour Surrogate-Control: no-store-remote.
Set this to on to have squid behave as a remote surrogate.
        
</PRE>
</P>

<DT><B>esi_parser libxml2|expat|custom</B><DD><P>
<PRE>
Default: custom

ESI markup is not strictly XML compatible. The custom ESI parser
will give higher performance, but cannot handle non ASCII character
encodings.
        
</PRE>
</P>

<DT><B>email_err_data on|off</B><DD><P>
<PRE>
Default: on

If enabled, information about the occurred error will be
included in the mailto links of the ERR pages (if %W is set)
so that the email body contains the data.
Syntax is &lt;A HREF="mailto:%w%W"&gt;%w&lt;/A&gt;
        
</PRE>
</P>

<DT><B>refresh_all_ims on|off</B><DD><P>
<PRE>
Default: off

When you enable this option, squid will always check
the origin server for an update when a client sends an
If-Modified-Since request.  Many browsers use IMS
requests when the user requests a reload, and this
ensures those clients receive the latest version.

By default (off), squid may return a Not Modified response
based on the age of the cached version.
        
</PRE>
</P>
<DT><B>request_header_access</B><DD><P>Replaces the header_access directive of Squid-2.6 and earlier, but applies to requests only.</P>
<DT><B>reply_header_access</B><DD><P>Replaces the header_access directive of Squid-2.6 and earlier, but applies to replies only.</P>

<DT><B>icap_enable on|off</B><DD><P>
<PRE>
Default: off

If you want to enable the ICAP module support, set this to on.
        
</PRE>
</P>
<DT><B>icap_preview_enable on|off</B><DD><P>
<PRE>
Default: off

Set this to 'on' if you want to enable the ICAP preview
feature in Squid.
        
</PRE>
</P>
<DT><B>icap_preview_size</B><DD><P>
<PRE>
Default: -1

The default size of preview data to be sent to the ICAP server.
-1 means no preview. This value might be overwritten on a per server
basis by OPTIONS requests.
        
</PRE>
</P>
<DT><B>icap_default_options_ttl (seconds)</B><DD><P>
<PRE>
Default: 60

The default TTL value for ICAP OPTIONS responses that don't have
an Options-TTL header.
        
</PRE>
</P>
<DT><B>icap_persistent_connections on|off</B><DD><P>
<PRE>
Default: on

Whether or not Squid should use persistent connections to
an ICAP server.
        
</PRE>
</P>
<DT><B>icap_send_client_ip on|off</B><DD><P>
<PRE>
Default: off

This adds the header "X-Client-IP" to ICAP requests.
        
</PRE>
</P>
<DT><B>icap_send_client_username on|off</B><DD><P>
<PRE>
Default: off

This adds the header "X-Client-Username" to ICAP requests
if proxy access is authentified.
        
</PRE>
</P>
<DT><B>icap_service</B><DD><P>
<PRE>
Default: none

Defines a single ICAP service

icap_service servicename vectoring_point bypass service_url

vectoring_point = reqmod_precache|reqmod_postcache|respmod_precache|respmod_postcache
This specifies at which point of request processing the ICAP
service should be plugged in.
bypass = 1|0
If set to 1 and the ICAP server cannot be reached, the request will go
through without being processed by an ICAP server
service_url = icap://servername:port/service

Note: reqmod_precache and respmod_postcache is not yet implemented

Example:
icap_service service_1 reqmod_precache 0 icap://icap1.mydomain.net:1344/reqmod
icap_service service_2 respmod_precache 0 icap://icap2.mydomain.net:1344/respmod
        
</PRE>
</P>
<DT><B>icap_class</B><DD><P>
<PRE>
Default: none

Defines an ICAP service chain. If there are multiple services per
vectoring point, they are processed in the specified order.

icap_class classname servicename...

Example:
icap_class class_1 service_1 service_2
icap class class_2 service_1 service_3
        
</PRE>
</P>
<DT><B>icap_access</B><DD><P>
<PRE>
Default: none

Redirects a request through an ICAP service class, depending
on given acls

icap_access classname allow|deny [!]aclname...

The icap_access statements are processed in the order they appear in
this configuration file. If an access list matches, the processing stops.
For an "allow" rule, the specified class is used for the request. A "deny"
rule simply stops processing without using the class. You can also use the
special classname "None".

For backward compatibility, it is also possible to use services
directly here.

Example:
icap_access class_1 allow all
        
</PRE>
</P>

<DT><B>accept_filter</B><DD><P>
<PRE>
The name of an accept(2) filter to install on Squid's
listen socket(s).  This feature is perhaps specific to
FreeBSD and requires support in the kernel.

The 'httpready' filter delays delivering new connections
to Squid until a full HTTP request has been received.
See the accf_http(9) man page.

<H3><A NAME="modifiedtags"></A> Changes to existing tags</H3>

<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>http_port</B><DD><P>New options:
<PRE>
    disable-pmtu-discovery=
      Control Path-MTU discovery usage:
        off          lets OS decide on what to do (default).
        transparent  disable PMTU discovery when transparent support is enabled.
        always       disable always PMTU discovery.

    In many setups of transparently intercepting proxies Path-MTU
    discovery can not work on traffic towards the clients. This is
    the case when the intercepting device does not fully track
    connections and fails to forward ICMP must fragment messages
    to the cache server. If you have such setup and experience that
    certain clients sporadically hang or never complete requests set
    disable-pmtu-discovery option to 'transparent'.

</PRE>
</P>
<DT><B>cache_peer</B><DD><P>New options:
<PRE>
     basetime=n

     background-ping

     weighted-round-robin

     use 'basetime=n' to specify a base amount to
     be subtracted from round trip times of parents.
     It is subtracted before division by weight in calculating
     which parent to fectch from. If the rtt is less than the
     base time the rtt is set to a minimal value.

     use 'background-ping' to only send ICP queries to this
     neighbor infrequently. This is used to keep the neighbor
     round trip time updated and is usually used in
     conjunction with weighted-round-robin.

     use 'weighted-round-robin' to define a set of parents
     which should be used in a round-robin fashion with the
     frequency of each parent being based on the round trip
     time. Closer parents are used more often.
     Usually used for background-ping parents.

</PRE>
</P>

<DT><B>refresh_pattern</B><DD><P>New options:
<PRE>
    ignore-no-store
    refresh-ims

    ignore-no-store ignores any ``Cache-control: no-store''
    headers received from a server. Doing this VIOLATES
    the HTTP standard. Enabling this feature could make you
    liable for problems which it causes.

    refresh-ims causes squid to contact the origin server
    when a client issues an If-Modified-Since request. This
    ensures that the client will receive an updated version
    if one is available.
